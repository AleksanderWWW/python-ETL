# python-ETL

My take on a simple ETL pipeline presented by *Mean, Median and Moose*.

---

## Introduction

In this project I take an ETL pipeline described in the YouTube video by *Mean, Median and Moose* [[1]] (#1)
and refactor it.
My aim is to make the project more modular and easier to use/debug.
Additionally I plan to make more extensive use of Object Oriented Programming paradigm, 
in comparison to the original, more 'linear' style of the project.
